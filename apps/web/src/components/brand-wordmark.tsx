/**
 * The active brand's wordmark.
 *
 * A map keyed by brand rather than a branch on it. The rule against
 * `if (brand === "hirist")` is about absorbing PRODUCT divergence into a
 * component — a logo is not a divergence, it is what a brand is, and the
 * `Record<Brand, …>` makes TypeScript demand a mark the day a third brand is
 * added rather than letting it silently fall through.
 *
 * The marks carry NO fill of their own, so they take `currentColor` from
 * whatever they sit in and need no dark-mode variant. That is also why they are
 * inlined rather than served as `<img src>`: an `<img>` cannot be recoloured,
 * and the sidebar is `sidebar-foreground` in one theme and its inverse in the
 * other.
